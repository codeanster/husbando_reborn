# husbando_reborn

## Next Steps :
* Set up Danbooru API and get .env file setup
* Run danbooru_image_dowloader.py until until there are ~10000 images
* refactor anime_face_detection.ipynb to work as a script to process all the images
* Resize all the cropped images to be the same (let's try 256 for now)
